![Starting Scene](https://github.com/Cele3x/game-engineering/blob/master/status-reports/20200205/wasp_teaser.png)

This repository was used for the development of the action game "Angry Stingers" carried out as part of the course "Game Engineering" in the winter semester 2019/2020 at the University of Regensburg. 

This folder contains the subfolders: 
- [build](https://github.com/Cele3x/game-engineering/tree/master/submission/build)
- [docs](https://github.com/Cele3x/game-engineering/tree/master/submission/docs)

## Build 
This folder contains the final version of the built and executable game "Angry Stingers".

## Docs
This folder contains the final version of the scientific paper about the development process and design concepts of the game written during the project. 
Furthermore, there is a fast-forwarded gameplay clip captured from the game and a link to the normal, not fast-forwarded version of the clip since its size exceeds the maximum file storage capacities for this repository.
The document about the technical supplement (in a PDF and a docx version) details the requirements of the interactivity and information on how the game will be presented at the conference.
