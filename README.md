# Angry Stingers

This repository is used for the development of the action game "Angry Stingers" carried out as part of the course "Game Engineering" in the winter semester 2019/2020 at the University of Regensburg.

The Unity project and all of the code were too large, so they couldn't be included into this repository directly. The project itself and all additional files can be found at https://github.com/Cele3x/game-engineering.
